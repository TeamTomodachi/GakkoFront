## Tab Pages

A few tabs have not been renamed from the application's initialization. 

The following are the current tab names and what they represent:

* Tab2 = Profile Page
* Tab3 = Raid Page
* Tab4 = User Creation Page

Feel free to rename, but be sure to fix the pointers to these tabs if a decision is made to rename.
